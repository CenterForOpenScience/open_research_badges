            <p class="lead">Strong documentation, public sharing, and other open science practices are recognized as desirable
                but are not often rewarded.
                Receiving credit for contributions to the research lifecycle can incentivize researchers to increase the transparency
                of their work.</p>
            <p> Open Research Badges are a mechanism for giving that credit.
                Badges are digital credentials&mdash;they are issued to an individual or group of individuals by a verifying
                body such as a journal or other organization. Badges can be displayed on a manuscript, resume, or a
                personal profile as a sign that the researcher practices open science. Several groups
                are investigating the application of badges for research.</p>
